# 💼 Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict a person’s salary based on their years of experience. It's a simple yet powerful example to understand the basics of supervised machine learning and regression modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict salaries using a single feature: **Years of Experience**. This is a classic example of **Simple Linear Regression**.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Salary Data - Kaggle / UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Features**:
  - `YearsExperience` — Number of years the person has worked
  - `Salary` — Annual salary of the person (target variable)

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Linear Regression**: A statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, we use a single feature — `YearsExperience`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Visualization**
3. **Splitting Data into Train/Test Sets**
4. **Model Training using Linear Regression**
5. **Prediction**
6. **Evaluation using Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared score
7. **Visualization of the Regression Line**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-prediction-linear-regression.git
cd salary-prediction-linear-regression
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook salary_prediction.ipynb
```

## ✅ Results

- The model shows a strong linear relationship between years of experience and salary.
- Good performance for a basic linear regression problem.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add more features like education level, job title, industry, etc.
- Try multiple regression models (Ridge, Lasso)
- Deploy as a web-based salary predictor
